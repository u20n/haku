- Haku 
  - ... is a concord graph viewer, designed to be as minimal as possible, but extended upon.
    - (this is primarily intended for messaging & other plain text protocols)

  - ... doesn't control any nodes, nor does it attempt to have any graph knowledge beyond rudimentary linking. **Use of a node controller is highly recommended.**
  - ... is linux first. There's no intention to support Windows natively; use WSL. (Apple; use at own risk)
