### Haku (WIP)
Haku is a concord graph viewer, designed to be as minimal as possible, but extended upon.

Haku on its own doesn't show much. Load a protocol overlay to see more detailed information about individual blocks.

##### Node / Graph Interaction
Haku doesn't control any nodes, nor does it attempt to have any graph knowledge beyond rudimentary linking.

Use a node controller to actually participate on a graph.
